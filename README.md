# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
---
Used Excel to conduct trend analysis on Kickstarter Campaign data
---
Findings:
---
*Failed kickstarter campaigns tended to have higher financial goals and lower money pledged. The mean goal for failed campaigns was twice the mean goal for successful campaigns, while the mean pledge for successful campaigns was 10x higher
---
*The month of May saw the highest number of successful campaigns, followed by June and July
---
The months with the most failed campaigns were January and October
---
Theatre saw the most successful campaigns but also the most failed
---
Within theatre, plays were also both the most successful and had the most failed campaigns
